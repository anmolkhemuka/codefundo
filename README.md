We will make an app that with the help of Machine Learning will predict the coming natural disaster. We will provide information to the app with the help of google like the temperature, humidity, pressure and the history of disasters that had come to that place. Than the app with the help of Machine Learning calculate the probability of occuring of that disaster in that area. Since the prediction of any natural disaster can't be made with 100% surity, our app will also just show the probability of occurence of that disaster. This app we will make with the help of Android Studio and will do Machine Learning on Anaconda. Our app will not be able to predict the instant occuring disasters like earthquake, landslide, lightening etc.

After that, we will also merge the GPS connection to the app so that at the time of disaster, we can trace the location of our known ones and the rescue team can also trace who so ever activate the app.
This will not require the internet connection too which is hardly available at the time of such calamities.

After that, it will also show that what steps should be taken at the time of a given natural disaster, what are the things that should be done and what shouldn't be. It will also provide the helpline number of necessary rescue team.
